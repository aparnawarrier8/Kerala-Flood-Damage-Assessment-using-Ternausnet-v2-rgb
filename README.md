# Kerala-Flood-Damage-Assessment-using-Ternausnet-v2-rgb
Kerala witnessed the worst floods of the century. More than 1M people got affected. 35 out of the 44 dams within the state were opened for the first time in history. Monsoon poured 41% extra rain resulted in a death of over 483 people. To assess the situation and damage, the current practice largely relies on emergency response crews and volunteers to drive around the affected area (also known as windshield survey). Recently, drone-based aerial images and satellite images have started to help improve situational awareness, but the process still relies on human visual inspection. These current approaches are generally time-onsuming and unreliable during an evolving disaster. With the rapid development of latest technologies of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Science, it makes sense to bridge the gap and utilize Deep Learning Techniques over Satellite Imageries to analyze the aftermath of a disaster better. It also addresses the most challenging tasks an administration faces- which is the accurate assesment of the damage caused due to a natural calamity to it's state. With this project, we inend to accurately analyze and quantify the damage/loss our state faced. Tools and Framework being used : (i) AWS for cloud services (ii) TernausNetV2 for building detection (U-Net Architecture) (iii) WorldView-3 Satellite Dataset from DigitalGlobe
